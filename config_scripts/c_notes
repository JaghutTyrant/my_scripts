Useful Compilation Flags:

-g : Adds symbols for debugging, should ALWAYS be add
-std=gnu11 : Allow code conforming C11 and POSIX standards 
                otherwise gcc will count certain now valid bits of syntax as invalid.

-std=gnu99 : ONLY if you system predates C11, which is equivalent to using the
                c99 command line compiler(just type 'man c99'), on make files
                just set cc=c99

-O3 : optimization level 3. Change it to -O0 if the the code is so optimized, 
        you can NOT understand it anymore while debugging.

-Wall : adds compiler warnings. Must ALWAYS BE ADD
