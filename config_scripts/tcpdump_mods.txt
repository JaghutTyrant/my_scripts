For cuckoo sanbox set up we have made the following things related to tcdump:
    first we installed the mac AppArmor.
        $ sudo apt-get install tcpdump apparmor-utils
    then we disable the AppArmor profile for tcpdump
        $ sudo aa-disable /usr/sbin/tcpdump
    Tcpdump requires root privileges, but since you don’t want Cuckoo to run as root you’ll have to set specific Linux capabilities to the binary:
        $ sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /usr/sbin/tcpdump
